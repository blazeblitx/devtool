### 3) Create a feature branch

Always create a branch for your work:

```bash
git checkout -b feat/short-description
# or
git checkout -b fix/short-description
```

### 4) Make changes and commit

* Keep changes focused (one feature/fix per PR).
* Follow the existing code style.
* Use sensible commit messages (imperative tense):

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat(header): add dark mode toggle"
```

### 5) Test locally

Run the project locally to ensure nothing broke:

```bash
# if using pnpm
pnpm install
pnpm dev

# if using npm
npm install
npm run dev
```

### 6) Push your branch and open a PR

```bash
git push -u origin feat/short-description
```

Go to GitHub → your fork → **Compare & pull request** → pick the upstream `main` as the base and write a clear description.

## 🧰 Development setup (recommended)

1. Install dependencies: `pnpm install` (or `npm install`).
2. Create `.env.local` from `.env.example` and fill secrets (do not commit).
3. Start dev server: `pnpm dev` (or `npm run dev`).

If you prefer Docker or have a local database, include instructions in `README.md`.

---

## 🧑‍⚖️ Code style & commit conventions

* Use TypeScript for new code where possible.
* Keep formatting consistent (Prettier recommended).
* Commit messages: use conventional-ish format e.g. `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`.

---

## 👩‍🏫 Reviewing process & maintainers

* Maintainers will review PRs and request changes if needed.
* Be responsive to review comments — small changes help fast merges.
* If maintainers agree a PR is valid but cannot merge, they may tag it `hacktoberfest-accepted`.

---

## 🛡 Security & sensitive data

* Never add secrets, passwords, or private keys to the repo.
* If you discover a security issue, contact the maintainers privately (see `SECURITY.md` if present).

---

## 📬 Contact & support

* Open an issue for help or discussion.
* Join repository Discussions (if enabled) for broader conversation.
